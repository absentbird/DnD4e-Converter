<h2><b>CHAPTER 2<br />
Getting to Know Kindle Content</b></h2>

<p>The Kindle Home screen gives you an overall picture of what you currently have on your Kindle. It shows you what has arrived recently, what you are reading, and where you are in your reading. It also allows you to remove content from your Kindle and to move content from Amazon.com to your Kindle. Read below for more details.</p>


<div id="id_2.1"></div>
<h2><b>2.1 The Home Screen</b></h2>

<p>Your Home screen displays a list of all of your Kindle reading materials - books, newspapers, magazines, blogs, personal documents, as well as audiobooks. It serves as a personal bookshelf for all of your reading material, as well as a starting point to access other Kindle features. </p> 


<p>To display the Home screen, press the Home button on the right edge of your Kindle. By default, the Home screen lists all of the items that you have on your Kindle beginning with the most recently viewed (or acquired) items. Each type of content has a slightly different description and label. You can read more about the types of content available in <a href="UG-C3.html#id_3.1">Chapter 3</a>.</p>


<h4 class="pagebreak"><b>Kindle Books</b></h4>

<p>Books are shown by title and author. Below the book title are a series of dots which give you an approximation of how long the book is.  Bold dots within the series indicate how far along you are in the book based on the last page you viewed.</p>


<h4><b>Periodicals</b></h4>

<p>Periodicals include newspapers and magazines that can be purchased as a single issue or as a subscription delivered on a regular basis. Your Home screen lists the most recent issue of each periodical you have on your Kindle. Older issues appear inside a grouping called Periodicals: Back Issues. Selecting the grouping takes you to a screen that displays the back issues of all the periodicals you have on your Kindle. Note that Kindle automatically deletes issues that are more than seven issues old to free up space for new content. An exclamation point <img alt="exclamation point" src="GraphicsC2/C2Image-exclamationpoint.gif" width="21" height="26" /> next to an issue indicates that it will be deleted within 48 hours.</p>


<h4><b>Blogs</b></h4>

<p>Blogs are subscription-based and appear on the Home screen as a single entry like books. As additional blog content arrives, it is added to the item and older entries are rolled off, much like a blog works on a computer.</p>


<h4><b>Audiobooks</b></h4>

<p>Audiobooks look similar to books, but they will be labeled in the Home screen as audio content. Like regular books, they have a progress indicator that shows where you are in the audiobook.</p>


<div id="HomeFeatures"></div>
<h3>Home Screen Features</h3>

<h3>More about Managing Items</h3>

<p>Amazon also stores the seven most recent issues of your newspapers and magazines. If you'd like to keep a copy of an issue indefinitely, open the issue, press the Menu button, and select "Keep this Issue"; you will then see the word "keep" to the left of the issue title in Home.</p>



<p>You can download items stored at Amazon.com any time you are within Whispernet coverage. If you are not within coverage, Kindle will automatically download the item when you re-enter Whispernet wireless service. </p>


<p>Personal documents sent to your Kindle are not backed up at Amazon.com.</p>


<p>When you remove a Kindle book you bought from Amazon, we automatically save all of your annotations for the book in case you ever want to download it again. However, if you remove a subscription issue that is older than seven days, a blog of any age, or an item you did not get from Amazon, any annotations you created on Kindle for those items do not get saved. Your "My Clippings" file will still remain as a separate file containing all the clippings you added regardless of whether the content is a book, subscription, or blog or was purchased from Amazon or not. See <a href="UG-C3.html#clippings">Chapter 3</a> for more information.</p>
