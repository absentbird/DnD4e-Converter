<h3>Registering or Deregistering Kindle</h3>
	
<p>Your Kindle needs to be registered with your Amazon.com account information to use many of the Kindle features such as purchasing content. If your Kindle is lost or transferred to another user, you should deregister your Kindle from your account. The process to register or deregister is described below. You can also register or deregister your Kindle on the Manage Your Kindle page on:</p>

<p>http://www.amazon.com/manageyourkindle</p>

 
<h4><b>Registering Your Kindle</b></h4>

<p>If your Kindle is not already registered, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are not already on the Home screen, press the Home button. </li>
<li>Press the Menu button.  Make sure that Whispernet is turned on.</li>
<li>Move the 5-way down until "Settings" is underlined and press to select. </li>
<li>Press the 5-way to select "Register."</li>
<li>You will see a text entry box at the bottom of the screen to enter your Amazon.com user name and password (the e-mail address and password associated with your Amazon account). Use the keyboard to enter in your information.</li>
<li>Navigate the 5-way to select "OK" to finish the registration process or "Cancel" to cancel your registration.</li>
</ol>

<i>Tip:</i> If your Amazon user name or password contains characters not present on the Kindle keyboard, press the Symbol key <img alt="Sym key" class="bottom" src="GraphicsC1/C1Image-symkey.gif" width="27" height="27" /> on the bottom of the keyboard to see a menu of additional characters and select the character you require.</p>

<p>Once registered, you can make purchases on the Kindle Store, convert personal documents on Amazon, use Basic Web, and take advantage of other Amazon-sponsored services. If your Kindle has incorrect registration information, deregister the device and then reregister it.</p>

<h4><b>Deregistering Your Kindle</b></h4>

<p>If you want to transfer ownership of your Kindle or return it for service or recycling, you should deregister it to prevent unauthorized purchases. The process is similar to the registration process described above. Just select "deregister" from the Registration section and select "ok" to confirm. Note that you will not be able to buy or download samples from the store, or use Basic Web if your Kindle is not registered.</p>


<p>You can also deregister your Kindle from the Manage Your Kindle page on Amazon.com.</p>
