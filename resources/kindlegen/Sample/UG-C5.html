<h2>
<b>CHAPTER 5<br />
The Kindle Store</b></h2>

<p>The Kindle Store is the place to purchase your Kindle books, newspapers, magazines, and blogs. Find an item in the store, select "Buy," and you will typically receive your item wirelessly in under a minute. All of your Kindle purchases use Amazon 1-Click for easy purchasing and Amazon automatically backs up all of your purchases in case you lose your Kindle or want to download a title again. To help other Amazon users decide what to buy, you can also add your own ratings and reviews.</p>

<h2><b>5.1 Getting Started at the Store</b></h2>

<p>This section tells you how to connect to the Kindle Store on your Kindle, and provides some ideas about the best ways to look for content once you are connected.</p>

<h3>Connecting to the Kindle Store</h3>
 
<p>You connect to the Kindle Store using your device's built-in Whispernet service. To go to the Kindle Store, follow these steps:</p>


<ol>
<li>If Whispernet is not already on, press the Menu button, move the 5-way controller up so that "Turn Wireless On" is underlined, and then press the 5-way to turn on Whispernet.  </li>
<li>Move the 5-way controller down to underline "Shop in Kindle Store."</li>
<li>Press the 5-way controller to select "Shop in Kindle Store." </li>
</ol>

<p>You will see this icon <img alt="Downloading Icon" src="GraphicsC1/C1Image-DownloadingIcon.gif" width="24" height="25" /> in the upper left corner of the page, if you are not already connected. The Kindle Storefront will appear as shown <a href="#storefront">later in this chapter</a> and serves as a launch point for all of the Kindle Store services.</p>
