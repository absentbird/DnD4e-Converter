h1. DnD4e Converter

h2. What

The DnD4e converter is a tool for converting the DnD4e files exported by the 4th edition character builder into mobi or epub format.

h2. How

DnD4e files are just xml. By parsing them you can generate html files which can then be formatted into epub and finally converted to mobi.

h2. Why

Because I got a Kindle and was tired of paying for buckets of ink and paper to finance my D&D habit. Also, why not? It is awesome!

h2. Now What?

I don't know really. The project has accomplished what I needed it for. If anyone wants to use it or improve it, it is here for them to fork with.
